/* File: sparrowRenderer
 * 
 * SparrowRenderer is for rendering 3D stuff to the target of sparrowPrimitives.
 * Like sparrowPrimitves it provides triangles, quads (with and without

 * surfaces, furthermore light calculation. Like other 3d libraries
 * (e.g. OpenGL) sparrow3d uses matrizes for the orientation and
 * position in space.*/
